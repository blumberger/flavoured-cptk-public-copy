Files needed for runnings XSH at PDI-T6 interface (with FE-CT):

HOMO_6T_AOM_COEFF.include --> AOM coeff T6  (which is the electron donor)
LUMO_PDI_AOM_COEFF.include --> AOM coeff PDI (which is the hole acceptor)
PCTDIH_b1155_ZAQZUM01_b1175_PDIEXC_b0930.prm --> TrESP charges PDI (which is the exciton tranport layer)

PCTDIH.psf --> topology PDI neutral
PCTDIH_ANION.psf --> topology PDI anion
PTCDIH_EXC_b0930.psf --> topology PDI exciton

ZAQZUM01.psf --> topology T6 neutral 
ZAQZUM01HOLE.psf --> topology T6 cation

PCTDIH_b1155_ZAQZUM01_b1175_PDIEXC_b0930.prm --> combined FF with types of PDI (anion+exciton+neutral) & T6 (cation+neutral)


CHECK TO DO:
- Check that when only FE is active PDI reorganization energy is: ~390 meV  (this I have checked it in part by regstesting to what I had before)
- Check that when only PDI is negatively charged, reorganization energy is: ~256 meV 
- Check that when only T6 is positevely charged, reorganization energy is: ~253 meV
